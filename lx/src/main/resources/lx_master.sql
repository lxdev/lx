These programs enable students to study established and emerging areas of law in light of modern challenges and developments. The following brief descriptions of these special programs are followed by links to more information. See also Choosing Your Curriculum at Notre Dame Law School, prepared by the faculty.\n\n\nProgram of Study in Business Law\nBusiness attorneys usually focus on either litigation or transactions. While much of the law school curriculum prepares the student for litigation practice, the Program of Study in Business Law emphasizes transactional practice: helping clients achieve their goals efficiently and responsibly, and in ways that minimize the risks and costs of litigation. The program has three substantive dimensions: corporate law, dealing with private ordering and the organization and management of both businesses and nonprofit organizations; tax law, the study of which includes careful thinking about the incentives and externalities associated with different tax policies; and commercial law, which structures and regulates the buying, selling, planning, and financing of a wide range of enterprises.\nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Criminal Law\nThe Program of Study in Criminal Law will help prepare students to participate in the crucial work of ordering society and protecting the vulnerable. Prosecutors and law-enforcement agents, acting on behalf of the entire community, vindicate the rule of law and the dignity of crime victims. Defense attorneys vigorously work to make sure that both individual rights and limits on government power are respected. Consistent with the high stakes involved, the criminal law is administered through complex and highly regulated processes in the United States and, in cases involving offenses against international law, in international tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court. \nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Environmental Law\nEnvironmental law is an important part of the American legal landscape. Once a niche field, environmental law is now a large and growing area of practice; expertise in the area is in high demand in local, national, and international legal markets. Moreover, familiarity with environmental law and related areas can be of great value to practitioners in other areas of law, given its intersection with fields such as commercial law, international law, and even criminal law. Notre Dame Law School offers a wide range of courses and activities for students with an interest in environmental law and its relation to energy, natural resources, and land use law. The Program of Study in Environmental Law provides students with a comprehensive educational foundation in order to prepare them to address a wide array of environmental issues in legal practice.\nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Global Law\nWhether dealing with the regulation of securities markets, the suppression of cross-border crimes, or the resolution of family law disputes, law today is inescapably global. Given the pervasively transnational nature of legal problems in today’s world, every legal professional needs to have a familiarity with the principles, sources, processes, and institutions of law that transcend the boundaries of national legal systems. Some students, however, will discover an interest in acquiring deeper and broader expertise in this area beyond the basic courses. The Program of Studies in Global Law offers those students a guide for crafting a comprehensive educational package in international, foreign, and comparative law.\nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Intellectual Property and Technology Law\nIntellectual property is one of the fastest-growing legal specialties in the United States, and increasingly in the world. Notre Dame Law School’s Program of Study in Intellectual Property and Technology Law prepares students to practice in a wide variety of intellectual property-related fields. Our faculty teach basic and advanced courses in the core doctrines of intellectual property (IP)—patent, copyright, trademark and unfair competition—and related fields including design, cyberlaw, and antitrust. \nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Law, Ethics, and Public Policy\nThe serious study of law is never far from the hard work of evaluation, of coming to judgments about the efficiency, reasonableness, and justice of the doctrines, rules, and statutes that are the bread-and-butter of law school classes. Legal education necessarily involves not only learning what the law is, and how it is applied and enforced, but also thinking critically about what it should be. The Program of Study in Law, Ethics, and Public Policy takes the task of critical moral evaluation and puts it at center stage. \nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Public Law\nPublic law regulates the structure of government and its relations with individuals and foreign nations, as well as the administration of public policy. Sound public law promotes individual well-being and the common good. The Constitution of the United States reflects one of the world’s most influential efforts to design a government that works both well and within limits. In ever increasing ways, public law pervades legal practice and offers lawyers extensive opportunities to serve the common good.

It is an intensive, integrated skills language\ncourse and covers academic reading and writing, discussion and oral presentation skills,\nand listening and speaking skills for the classroom and business environments.\nAdditionally, throughout the course, students’ vocabulary and pronunciation skills are\nenhanced. The first term focuses on an orientation to the US law classroom and living in\nthe US, helping students develop language skills to thrive in many different\nenvironments. The spring term focuses on academic researching, reading, and writing\nskills, giving students the tools necessary for writing academic research papers.\nU.S. Legal Culture (two hours per week + additional time for visits to cultural\nattractions)\nThis course serves as an introduction to general U.S. culture and provides background in\nthe historical and contemporary context of U.S. legal culture. The main purpose of this\nclass is to give students a wide variety of opportunities to increase their oral proficiency\nin English while learning about U.S. legal culture. By reading cases and fiction, viewing\nfilms, interacting with guest speakers, and visiting cultural landmarks, students gain an\nunderstanding of the social, legal, and political climate at the federal level in Washington\nD.C. Highlights of the class include visits to the Law Library of Congress, the Supreme\nCourt of the United States, and the National Archives. These visits allow students\nopportunities to explore their perceptions and interpretations of legal topics within the\nU.S. cultural context.

The main focus will be on what occurs during lecture, including following\nand understanding exchanges between the professor and students, participating 2\neffectively during class, distinguishing between significant discussions and minor\ndigressions, and taking notes. Additional attention will be given to the activities students\nengage in outside of lecture, including reading and preparing for class, synthesizing\ninformation presented in lecture with readings to compose a coherent picture of specific\nlegal concepts and the course as a whole, and preparing for and taking exams.\nTransnational Legal Skills Workshop (one week after classes finish in December)\nThis is an intensive, problem based course that will explore the role of law in a global\ncontext. The problem will be one that involves both U.S. and non-U.S. law and forces\nstudents to examine how to be effective as a lawyer in a dispute that crosses borders.\nStudents will be broken into teams to represent “clients” and to participate in a mock\nnegotiation, arbitration, or court hearing.\nSpring Semester Courses\nEnglish for International Lawyers (six hours per week)\nLegal Writing (two hours per week)\nThis course builds on U.S. Legal Discourse I and II by further developing research,\nanalytical and writing skills and applying them in the context of an appellate brief\nproblem.

At the end of the course students will present the \"best of\" their presentations to\na larger audience.\nIntroduction to Scholarly Writing (two hours per week)\nThis course introduces students to scholarly legal writing, focusing on the writing process\nand the expectations of the audience in the legal discourse community. Students will be\nintroduced to legal research techniques for selecting a topic and thesis for a scholarly\npaper and will engage in all steps of the writing process, including creating an initial\noutline, writing a draft, rewriting and revising for completeness and clarity, and\npolishing. In addition to regular class meetings to discuss research strategies, outlining 3\ntechniques, organizational tools, use of footnotes for authority and attribution, and\naudience expectations, students will meet regularly with the professor in one-on-one\nconferences to discuss the progress of their papers and will receive feedback from the\nprofessor at each stage of the writing process. Students will be required to research and\nwrite an original scholarly paper of at least 10-15 pages in length and to engage in\nmultiple revisions of the paper.\nElective\nStudents will select one course from the regular LL.M. curriculum to audit.

The following brief descriptions of these special programs are followed by links to more information. See also Choosing Your Curriculum at Notre Dame Law School, prepared by the faculty.\n\n\nProgram of Study in Business Law\nBusiness attorneys usually focus on either litigation or transactions. While much of the law school curriculum prepares the student for litigation practice, the Program of Study in Business Law emphasizes transactional practice: helping clients achieve their goals efficiently and responsibly, and in ways that minimize the risks and costs of litigation. The program has three substantive dimensions: corporate law, dealing with private ordering and the organization and management of both businesses and nonprofit organizations; tax law, the study of which includes careful thinking about the incentives and externalities associated with different tax policies; and commercial law, which structures and regulates the buying, selling, planning, and financing of a wide range of enterprises.\nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Criminal Law\nThe Program of Study in Criminal Law will help prepare students to participate in the crucial work of ordering society and protecting the vulnerable. Prosecutors and law-enforcement agents, acting on behalf of the entire community, vindicate the rule of law and the dignity of crime victims. Defense attorneys vigorously work to make sure that both individual rights and limits on government power are respected. Consistent with the high stakes involved, the criminal law is administered through complex and highly regulated processes in the United States and, in cases involving offenses against international law, in international tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court. \nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Environmental Law\nEnvironmental law is an important part of the American legal landscape. Once a niche field, environmental law is now a large and growing area of practice; expertise in the area is in high demand in local, national, and international legal markets. Moreover, familiarity with environmental law and related areas can be of great value to practitioners in other areas of law, given its intersection with fields such as commercial law, international law, and even criminal law. Notre Dame Law School offers a wide range of courses and activities for students with an interest in environmental law and its relation to energy, natural resources, and land use law. The Program of Study in Environmental Law provides students with a comprehensive educational foundation in order to prepare them to address a wide array of environmental issues in legal practice.\nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Global Law\nWhether dealing with the regulation of securities markets, the suppression of cross-border crimes, or the resolution of family law disputes, law today is inescapably global. Given the pervasively transnational nature of legal problems in today’s world, every legal professional needs to have a familiarity with the principles, sources, processes, and institutions of law that transcend the boundaries of national legal systems. Some students, however, will discover an interest in acquiring deeper and broader expertise in this area beyond the basic courses. The Program of Studies in Global Law offers those students a guide for crafting a comprehensive educational package in international, foreign, and comparative law.\nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Intellectual Property and Technology Law\nIntellectual property is one of the fastest-growing legal specialties in the United States, and increasingly in the world. Notre Dame Law School’s Program of Study in Intellectual Property and Technology Law prepares students to practice in a wide variety of intellectual property-related fields. Our faculty teach basic and advanced courses in the core doctrines of intellectual property (IP)—patent, copyright, trademark and unfair competition—and related fields including design, cyberlaw, and antitrust. \nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Law, Ethics, and Public Policy\nThe serious study of law is never far from the hard work of evaluation, of coming to judgments about the efficiency, reasonableness, and justice of the doctrines, rules, and statutes that are the bread-and-butter of law school classes. Legal education necessarily involves not only learning what the law is, and how it is applied and enforced, but also thinking critically about what it should be. The Program of Study in Law, Ethics, and Public Policy takes the task of critical moral evaluation and puts it at center stage. \nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Public Law\nPublic law regulates the structure of government and its relations with individuals and foreign nations, as well as the administration of public policy. Sound public law promotes individual well-being and the common good. The Constitution of the United States reflects one of the world’s most influential efforts to design a government that works both well and within limits. In ever increasing ways, public law pervades legal practice and offers lawyers extensive opportunities to serve the common good. The Notre Dame Law School’s Program of Study in Public Law provides a rich course of study for students interested in government lawyering, judicial clerkships, criminal justice, constitutional litigation, administrative regulation and adjudication, public policy, and many other public law fields.

The focus is on transactional problems and legal solutions. Students will apply their experience and existing knowledge while developing new skills and expanding their knowledge of international transactions including the commercial terms of international sales agreements, and the allocation of shipping responsibilities/risk of loss and bills of lading; financing arrangements and letters of credit; intellectual property issues including protecting and licensing IP; franchising and distribution agreements; foreign investment; applicable government regulation of trade including import barriers, antidumping duties, competition/antitrust compliance and fraud/bribery regulation; and international dispute resolution. Throughout the course the relationship between law, culture and ethics will be considered.\n\nOne of the following required skills-based courses:\n\nContracts Drafting | LAWS 4178 \nThis course addresses the perspectives and skills that a lawyer must develop in order to assist clients with transactional work and aligning business objectives and contracts. In addition to delving deeper into selected areas of substantive contract law, students will read materials that focus on writing and interpreting contractual provisions. Because a core focus of the class is writing for contracts, students will regularly engage in drafting exercises to hone their drafting skills. The course will also focus on negotiation in a transactional setting, and how discussions with both clients and other parties can distill the key business terms that are to be reflected in a contract. Although substantive law and theory will be utilized throughout the course, the primary objective of the course is exposing students to some of the practical, “real-world” skills essential to a transactional law practice.\n\nCorporate Drafting Seminar | LAWS 4181\nCorporate drafting focuses on writing responsive, lucid, unambiguous corporate documents. Students assume the role of the in-house counsel and other members of the corporate negotiating team as the team structures, negotiates, drafts, and implements corporate transactions. This course requires extensive writing.\n\nNegotiation and Drafting in an International Business Context \nThis course will focus on the basic principles of negotiation and contract drafting, as applied to international business transactions. Special emphasis will be placed on financial and corporate contracts, with a focus on a cross-border merger and acquisition transaction. The material will be divided into three parts. First, we will cover the basic principles of effective negotiation, paying particular attention to issues of cultural understanding and inter-cultural communication. Second, we will cover the basic principles of clear and unambiguous contract drafting and we will study the basic ‘geography’ or building blocks of the contract. Finally, we will review and understand specific types of agreements; particular attention will be given to the Merger and Acquisition process and to the US financial system by studying Credit Agreements and other types of credit support documentation. The seminar is taught through a combination of lectures and hands-on drafting and negotiation exercises.\n\nOne of the following courses is required for all International Students (not holding a J.D. from an accredited U.S. law school):\n\nAmerican Legal System: Research, Writing and Analysis | LAWS 4064 \nThis course addresses the principles governing the American legal system and provides a brief comparison of the U.S. system to a sampling of other legal systems. In addition, the course addresses the organization of the court system, the anatomy of a lawsuit, and some of the ethical rules governing lawyers. Legal reasoning, standard legal analysis method, and reasoning by analogy will be covered. A broad overview of American civil procedure and constitutional law are included. Also, because this is a critical election year, legal issues impacted by the upcoming election will be explored. Finally, more practical skills such as legal research, legal writing and exam-taking skills will be addressed.\n\nLegal Writing (Advanced) | L4651\nCourse involves a series of writing assignments, normally related.

The course uses hypothetical cases to teach the student trial preparation, strategy, and conduct in a courtroom setting. Although the instructor will demonstrate from time to time, the primary teaching method is student participation with instructor critique. Classes often run longer than three hours.\n\nEvidence and the Art of Advocacy (LAW 207)\nStudents taking this course (a special section of the basic Evidence course) will also take a designated section of Trial Advocacy 1 in the same semester. Students will receive a total of six credit hours and will receive one grade for the entire six credits. Pass/fail is not available. The course is designed for students who have a serious interest in litigation and wish to be trial lawyers. The goal is that the students receive a clear mastery of the rules of Evidence at the same time learning to master the practical application of those rules in the courtroom. You will be applying the rules of evidence as they are discussed each week in class in your Trial Advocacy sections that same week. The Evidence component will be taught by Justice Erickson, and the Trial Advocacy 1 sections will be taught by three experienced trial lawyers. The course will be limited to twenty-four students for the Evidence portion; students will be assigned, in groups of eight, to one of the Trial Advocacy sections. There will be an Evidence final, a midterm bench trial, and a final jury trial. We believe this integrated hands-on approach will provide each student with a superior knowledge of the rules of evidence as well as the application of those rules.\n\nIntroduction to American Legal Systems (LAW 210)\nThis course provides an overview of American constitutional and procedural law, with an introduction to the U.S. judicial system, legal methodology, and government structure. The course is open only to exchange students and students in the LL.M. Program in U.S., International and Transnational Law.\n\nProfessional Responsibility-Ethics & Advocacy (LAW 137)\nThe ground rules of ethical advocacy are key to becoming an effective and respected litigator. This problem-based class will allow you to practice advocacy skills while learning about the Rules of Professional Conduct and other ethical issues that govern your practice. Using a problem all semester, you will learn and practice skills including: client and witness interviews, preparing your client or witness for depositions, preparing and presenting actual conflict waivers, conducting direct and cross examinations, presenting opening and closing statements, and handling other ethical issues, for example what to do if a witness or your client lies in a matter before a tribunal. The semester will conclude with an actual trial conducted by the students. Class will meet twice a week with a portion devoted to presentation of course materials, by lecture, video and film clips, and class discussion of the assigned reading. The remaining portion of each class will be devoted to role play exercises by the students. Our objective is for you to learn while enjoying the experience, doing it yourselves with our guidance. Taking this class will satisfy the graduation Professional Responsibility requirement.\n\nSecond Semester\nTrial Advocacy 2 (LAW 558)\nAn in-depth study and performance of litigation skills in certain trial settings. The course is a continuation of Trial Advocacy 1. Classes often run longer than three hours.\n\nLitigation Technology (LAW 254)\nThis course will teach law students interested in becoming trial lawyers how to integrate technology into their trial presentations. Students will learn how to apply principles of persuasion to the creation of courtroom visuals which they will then present in the trial advocacy portion of the course. The course will use hypothetical problems and cases to allow students to develop presentations that persuade and will include computer lab sections, some lecture, and student participation with instructor critique. Students will try civil cases and criminal cases. Students should own their own laptop computers and be prepared to bring them to class every week. The machine should be Windows-compatible. The class may run longer than three hours when students try their mock trials.\n\nSpecialized Externship\nThis dynamic externship allows international students the opportunity of working alongside practicing litigating attorneys within both civil and criminal practices.  The seven credit hours set aside for the externship are designed by the student and the LL.M director/advisor and could encompass exposure to one or two different disciplines; civil and/or criminal; prosecution/plaintiff and/or defense. Students are required to keep a journal as well as produce a paper detailing a critical component of their externship experience. The faculty director meets with students regularly to assess learning outcomes.\n\n- See more at: http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/academics/llm-programs/trial-advocacy-for-international-students/course-descriptions#sthash.h4gXuFqF.dpuf', '100', '0', 'Successful applicants to the LL.M. program typically have a TOEFL score of approximately 600 on the paper based test, 250 on the computer based test, or 100 on the internet based test, or a score of 7.0 on the IELTS test. - See more at: http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/prospective-students/llm-program-admissions/llm-in-financial-services-law#sthash.0rdkFXnM.dpuf', '7', '0', '', '0', '', '-2', '', '', '-2', '', '', '0', '', '1', 'Candidates who have fulfilled the educational requirements for admission to the practice of law in a foreign country, including a law degree from an institution recognized by the competent accrediting agency of the government of the foreign country', '0', '', '优先录取：2月1日\n常规申请：4月1日', '', '', '', '', 'http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/academics/llm-programs/trial-advocacy-for-international-students', 'http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/prospective-students/llm-program-admissions/llm-in-trial-advocacy-for-international-students');

These programs enable students to study established and emerging areas of law in light of modern challenges and developments. The following brief descriptions of these special programs are followed by links to more information. See also Choosing Your Curriculum at Notre Dame Law School, prepared by the faculty.\n\n\nProgram of Study in Business Law\nBusiness attorneys usually focus on either litigation or transactions. While much of the law school curriculum prepares the student for litigation practice, the Program of Study in Business Law emphasizes transactional practice: helping clients achieve their goals efficiently and responsibly, and in ways that minimize the risks and costs of litigation. The program has three substantive dimensions: corporate law, dealing with private ordering and the organization and management of both businesses and nonprofit organizations; tax law, the study of which includes careful thinking about the incentives and externalities associated with different tax policies; and commercial law, which structures and regulates the buying, selling, planning, and financing of a wide range of enterprises.\nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Criminal Law\nThe Program of Study in Criminal Law will help prepare students to participate in the crucial work of ordering society and protecting the vulnerable. Prosecutors and law-enforcement agents, acting on behalf of the entire community, vindicate the rule of law and the dignity of crime victims. Defense attorneys vigorously work to make sure that both individual rights and limits on government power are respected. Consistent with the high stakes involved, the criminal law is administered through complex and highly regulated processes in the United States and, in cases involving offenses against international law, in international tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court. \nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Environmental Law\nEnvironmental law is an important part of the American legal landscape. Once a niche field, environmental law is now a large and growing area of practice; expertise in the area is in high demand in local, national, and international legal markets. Moreover, familiarity with environmental law and related areas can be of great value to practitioners in other areas of law, given its intersection with fields such as commercial law, international law, and even criminal law. Notre Dame Law School offers a wide range of courses and activities for students with an interest in environmental law and its relation to energy, natural resources, and land use law. The Program of Study in Environmental Law provides students with a comprehensive educational foundation in order to prepare them to address a wide array of environmental issues in legal practice.\nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Global Law\nWhether dealing with the regulation of securities markets, the suppression of cross-border crimes, or the resolution of family law disputes, law today is inescapably global. Given the pervasively transnational nature of legal problems in today’s world, every legal professional needs to have a familiarity with the principles, sources, processes, and institutions of law that transcend the boundaries of national legal systems. Some students, however, will discover an interest in acquiring deeper and broader expertise in this area beyond the basic courses. The Program of Studies in Global Law offers those students a guide for crafting a comprehensive educational package in international, foreign, and comparative law.\nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Intellectual Property and Technology Law\nIntellectual property is one of the fastest-growing legal specialties in the United States, and increasingly in the world. Notre Dame Law School’s Program of Study in Intellectual Property and Technology Law prepares students to practice in a wide variety of intellectual property-related fields. Our faculty teach basic and advanced courses in the core doctrines of intellectual property (IP)—patent, copyright, trademark and unfair competition—and related fields including design, cyberlaw, and antitrust. \nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Law, Ethics, and Public Policy\nThe serious study of law is never far from the hard work of evaluation, of coming to judgments about the efficiency, reasonableness, and justice of the doctrines, rules, and statutes that are the bread-and-butter of law school classes. Legal education necessarily involves not only learning what the law is, and how it is applied and enforced, but also thinking critically about what it should be. The Program of Study in Law, Ethics, and Public Policy takes the task of critical moral evaluation and puts it at center stage. \nRead More\n\nProgram of Study in Public Law\nPublic law regulates the structure of government and its relations with individuals and foreign nations, as well as the administration of public policy. Sound public law promotes individual well-being and the common good. The Constitution of the United States reflects one of the world’s most influential efforts to design a government that works both well and within limits. In ever increasing ways, public law pervades legal practice and offers lawyers extensive opportunities to serve the common good. The Notre Dame Law School’s Program of Study in Public Law provides a rich course of study for students interested in government lawyering, judicial clerkships, criminal justice, constitutional litigation, administrative regulation and adjudication, public policy, and many other public law fields.

The spring term focuses on academic researching, reading, and writing\nskills, giving students the tools necessary for writing academic research papers.\nU.S. Legal Culture (two hours per week + additional time for visits to cultural\nattractions)\nThis course serves as an introduction to general U.S. culture and provides background in\nthe historical and contemporary context of U.S. legal culture. The main purpose of this\nclass is to give students a wide variety of opportunities to increase their oral proficiency\nin English while learning about U.S. legal culture. By reading cases and fiction, viewing\nfilms, interacting with guest speakers, and visiting cultural landmarks, students gain an\nunderstanding of the social, legal, and political climate at the federal level in Washington\nD.C. Highlights of the class include visits to the Law Library of Congress, the Supreme\nCourt of the United States, and the National Archives. These visits allow students\nopportunities to explore their perceptions and interpretations of legal topics within the\nU.S. cultural context.

The course will be composed of two parts: (1) a three-hour per week corporations\nlaw lecture and (2) a two-hour analysis and discussion of the American law school\nclassroom. The corporations law lecture will be a basic course in business corporations\nand serve as the foundation for the discussions that take place during the second part of\nthe course. The main focus will be on what occurs during lecture, including following\nand understanding exchanges between the professor and students, participating 2\neffectively during class, distinguishing between significant discussions and minor\ndigressions, and taking notes. Additional attention will be given to the activities students\nengage in outside of lecture, including reading and preparing for class, synthesizing\ninformation presented in lecture with readings to compose a coherent picture of specific\nlegal concepts and the course as a whole, and preparing for and taking exams.\nTransnational Legal Skills Workshop (one week after classes finish in December)\nThis is an intensive, problem based course that will explore the role of law in a global\ncontext. The problem will be one that involves both U.S. and non-U.S. law and forces\nstudents to examine how to be effective as a lawyer in a dispute that crosses borders.\nStudents will be broken into teams to represent “clients” and to participate in a mock\nnegotiation, arbitration, or court hearing.\nSpring Semester Courses\nEnglish for International Lawyers (six hours per week)\nLegal Writing (two hours per week)\nThis course builds on U.S. Legal Discourse I and II by further developing research,\nanalytical and writing skills and applying them in the context of an appellate brief\nproblem. Students will be assigned a fictional client who they will represent through the\nappeals process, including writing an appellate brief and making arguments orally before\na panel of judges.\nOral Presentation Skills for International Lawyers (two hours per week)\nIn this course students have a variety of opportunities to develop their oral presentation\nskills for professional and personal communication in English. The design of the course\ncovers a range of oral communication skills ranging from informal, impromptu\nconversations to well-prepared legal academic presentations.

At the end of the course students will present the \"best of\" their presentations to\na larger audience.\nIntroduction to Scholarly Writing (two hours per week)\nThis course introduces students to scholarly legal writing, focusing on the writing process\nand the expectations of the audience in the legal discourse community. Students will be\nintroduced to legal research techniques for selecting a topic and thesis for a scholarly\npaper and will engage in all steps of the writing process, including creating an initial\noutline, writing a draft, rewriting and revising for completeness and clarity, and\npolishing. In addition to regular class meetings to discuss research strategies, outlining 3\ntechniques, organizational tools, use of footnotes for authority and attribution, and\naudience expectations, students will meet regularly with the professor in one-on-one\nconferences to discuss the progress of their papers and will receive feedback from the\nprofessor at each stage of the writing process. Students will be required to research and\nwrite an original scholarly paper of at least 10-15 pages in length and to engage in\nmultiple revisions of the paper.\nElective\nStudents will select one course from the regular LL.M. curriculum to audit.

The focus is on transactional problems and legal solutions. Students will apply their experience and existing knowledge while developing new skills and expanding their knowledge of international transactions including the commercial terms of international sales agreements, and the allocation of shipping responsibilities/risk of loss and bills of lading; financing arrangements and letters of credit; intellectual property issues including protecting and licensing IP; franchising and distribution agreements; foreign investment; applicable government regulation of trade including import barriers, antidumping duties, competition/antitrust compliance and fraud/bribery regulation; and international dispute resolution. Throughout the course the relationship between law, culture and ethics will be considered.\n\nOne of the following required skills-based courses:\n\nContracts Drafting | LAWS 4178 \nThis course addresses the perspectives and skills that a lawyer must develop in order to assist clients with transactional work and aligning business objectives and contracts. In addition to delving deeper into selected areas of substantive contract law, students will read materials that focus on writing and interpreting contractual provisions. Because a core focus of the class is writing for contracts, students will regularly engage in drafting exercises to hone their drafting skills. The course will also focus on negotiation in a transactional setting, and how discussions with both clients and other parties can distill the key business terms that are to be reflected in a contract. Although substantive law and theory will be utilized throughout the course, the primary objective of the course is exposing students to some of the practical, “real-world” skills essential to a transactional law practice.\n\nCorporate Drafting Seminar | LAWS 4181\nCorporate drafting focuses on writing responsive, lucid, unambiguous corporate documents. Students assume the role of the in-house counsel and other members of the corporate negotiating team as the team structures, negotiates, drafts, and implements corporate transactions. This course requires extensive writing.\n\nNegotiation and Drafting in an International Business Context \nThis course will focus on the basic principles of negotiation and contract drafting, as applied to international business transactions. Special emphasis will be placed on financial and corporate contracts, with a focus on a cross-border merger and acquisition transaction. The material will be divided into three parts. First, we will cover the basic principles of effective negotiation, paying particular attention to issues of cultural understanding and inter-cultural communication. Second, we will cover the basic principles of clear and unambiguous contract drafting and we will study the basic ‘geography’ or building blocks of the contract. Finally, we will review and understand specific types of agreements; particular attention will be given to the Merger and Acquisition process and to the US financial system by studying Credit Agreements and other types of credit support documentation. The seminar is taught through a combination of lectures and hands-on drafting and negotiation exercises.\n\nOne of the following courses is required for all International Students (not holding a J.D. from an accredited U.S. law school):\n\nAmerican Legal System: Research, Writing and Analysis | LAWS 4064 \nThis course addresses the principles governing the American legal system and provides a brief comparison of the U.S. system to a sampling of other legal systems. In addition, the course addresses the organization of the court system, the anatomy of a lawsuit, and some of the ethical rules governing lawyers. Legal reasoning, standard legal analysis method, and reasoning by analogy will be covered. A broad overview of American civil procedure and constitutional law are included. Also, because this is a critical election year, legal issues impacted by the upcoming election will be explored. Finally, more practical skills such as legal research, legal writing and exam-taking skills will be addressed.\n\nLegal Writing (Advanced) | L4651\nCourse involves a series of writing assignments, normally related. Typically, students research an initial legal issue, and then draft a first office memo. After receiving detailed feedback, students do at least one revision of that first office memo. Students then undertake research for a second legal issue, and then draft a second office memo. After receiving detailed feedback, students then do a revision of that second office memo. Finally, students use the final versions of those two office memos to create a court document, which they then revise as their final assignment.', '1', 'Prospective foreign applicants are eligible to apply if one of the following is satisfied: (a) graduated from a U.S. law school that is approved by the American Bar Association, or (b) obtained a full degree in law from a recognized non-U.S. institution.', '0', '', null, '', 'http://www.law.du.edu/index.php/international-business-transactions', 'http://www.law.du.edu/index.php/international-business-transactions/prospective-students/admissions-information/international-students', null, null, null, null);

The course uses hypothetical cases to teach the student trial preparation, strategy, and conduct in a courtroom setting. Although the instructor will demonstrate from time to time, the primary teaching method is student participation with instructor critique. Classes often run longer than three hours.\n\nEvidence and the Art of Advocacy (LAW 207)\nStudents taking this course (a special section of the basic Evidence course) will also take a designated section of Trial Advocacy 1 in the same semester. Students will receive a total of six credit hours and will receive one grade for the entire six credits. Pass/fail is not available. The course is designed for students who have a serious interest in litigation and wish to be trial lawyers. The goal is that the students receive a clear mastery of the rules of Evidence at the same time learning to master the practical application of those rules in the courtroom. You will be applying the rules of evidence as they are discussed each week in class in your Trial Advocacy sections that same week. The Evidence component will be taught by Justice Erickson, and the Trial Advocacy 1 sections will be taught by three experienced trial lawyers. The course will be limited to twenty-four students for the Evidence portion; students will be assigned, in groups of eight, to one of the Trial Advocacy sections. There will be an Evidence final, a midterm bench trial, and a final jury trial. We believe this integrated hands-on approach will provide each student with a superior knowledge of the rules of evidence as well as the application of those rules.\n\nIntroduction to American Legal Systems (LAW 210)\nThis course provides an overview of American constitutional and procedural law, with an introduction to the U.S. judicial system, legal methodology, and government structure. The course is open only to exchange students and students in the LL.M. Program in U.S., International and Transnational Law.\n\nProfessional Responsibility-Ethics & Advocacy (LAW 137)\nThe ground rules of ethical advocacy are key to becoming an effective and respected litigator. This problem-based class will allow you to practice advocacy skills while learning about the Rules of Professional Conduct and other ethical issues that govern your practice. Using a problem all semester, you will learn and practice skills including: client and witness interviews, preparing your client or witness for depositions, preparing and presenting actual conflict waivers, conducting direct and cross examinations, presenting opening and closing statements, and handling other ethical issues, for example what to do if a witness or your client lies in a matter before a tribunal. The semester will conclude with an actual trial conducted by the students. Class will meet twice a week with a portion devoted to presentation of course materials, by lecture, video and film clips, and class discussion of the assigned reading. The remaining portion of each class will be devoted to role play exercises by the students. Our objective is for you to learn while enjoying the experience, doing it yourselves with our guidance. Taking this class will satisfy the graduation Professional Responsibility requirement.\n\nSecond Semester\nTrial Advocacy 2 (LAW 558)\nAn in-depth study and performance of litigation skills in certain trial settings. The course is a continuation of Trial Advocacy 1. Classes often run longer than three hours.\n\nLitigation Technology (LAW 254)\nThis course will teach law students interested in becoming trial lawyers how to integrate technology into their trial presentations. Students will learn how to apply principles of persuasion to the creation of courtroom visuals which they will then present in the trial advocacy portion of the course. The course will use hypothetical problems and cases to allow students to develop presentations that persuade and will include computer lab sections, some lecture, and student participation with instructor critique. Students will try civil cases and criminal cases. Students should own their own laptop computers and be prepared to bring them to class every week. The machine should be Windows-compatible. The class may run longer than three hours when students try their mock trials.\n\nSpecialized Externship\nThis dynamic externship allows international students the opportunity of working alongside practicing litigating attorneys within both civil and criminal practices.  The seven credit hours set aside for the externship are designed by the student and the LL.M director/advisor and could encompass exposure to one or two different disciplines; civil and/or criminal; prosecution/plaintiff and/or defense. Students are required to keep a journal as well as produce a paper detailing a critical component of their externship experience. The faculty director meets with students regularly to assess learning outcomes.\n\n- See more at: http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/academics/llm-programs/trial-advocacy-for-international-students/course-descriptions#sthash.h4gXuFqF.dpuf', '1', 'Candidates who have fulfilled the educational requirements for admission to the practice of law in a foreign country, including a law degree from an institution recognized by the competent accrediting agency of the government of the foreign country', '0', '', null, '', 'http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/academics/llm-programs/trial-advocacy-for-international-students', 'http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/prospective-students/llm-program-admissions/llm-in-trial-advocacy-for-international-students', null, null, null, null);
